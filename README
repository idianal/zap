zap
===

macOS does not currently have a publisher-supported way to easily remove the small pieces of gunk your apps leave behind. `zap` is a way to remove unwanted macOS apps, along with their preference files, etc. It is meant as an open source, CLI-based alternative to proprietary "cleaner" apps.
